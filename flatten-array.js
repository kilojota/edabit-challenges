// I'm trying to write a function to flatten an array of subarrays into one array. (Suppose I am unware there is a .flat() method in the Array prototype). In other words, I want to transform this: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] into [1, 2, 3, 4].
// Fix this incorrect code so that all tests pass!
function flatten(arr) {
  arr2 = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
      arr2.push(arr[i][j]);
    }
  }
  return arr2;
}

// Great solution, now think of a way to flatten an array that might have multiple nested arrays.
// For example: [[1,2,3], [[4,5], [6], 7]]
